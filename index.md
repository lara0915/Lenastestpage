# The sunniest city in Germany 

Freiburg markets itself as the city in German with most hours of **sunshine** over the year. On top, the city emphasizes its image as a *young, modern and innovative*. On this, see for example [Freiburg City Marketing](https://fwtm.freiburg.de/pb/761044.html). So then, why is it raining and why do students not know how to properly insert commas into their texts? (Well, I guess that is innovation)

Freiburg food is particular. It has weird names and contains big heaps of means. Nonetheless, some of it is tasty. In German, you can say: "Das ist lecker." So, you really have to misspell Dayton Lekner's name.

Brägele, for example, are called Bratkartoffeln in the rest of Germany. That is how they look like. Anyway, they are all potatoes. ![image of Baden Bratkartoffeln:](https://www.naturgarten-kaiserstuhl.de/adbimage/421/width_240/5255c90b42d414fbe69923c02d6fc5e9.jpg)
